I have the problem domain, and possibly a working main class that I hopefully
copied correctly.

I have to implement printPopulation and printWorld.

I'll tackle printPopulation first.

By the looks of it, it seems like my classes are going to need to extend from
an abstract class because of the constructor situation.

PrintPopulation and printWorld are probably going to be interfaces.
