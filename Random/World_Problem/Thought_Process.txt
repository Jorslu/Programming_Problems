I have the problem domain, and possibly a working main class that I hopefully
copied correctly.

I have to implement printPopulation and printWorld.

I'll tackle printPopulation first.

By the looks of it, it seems like my classes are going to need to extend from
an abstract class because of the constructor situation.

PrintPopulation and printWorld are probably going to be interfaces.

I'm thinking I need one Population Interface and two methods for the different
population functions. One is going to recursively call it's children while
passing the populationTotal parameter (For World, Country, and States) and
another is going to add it's (this->population) to the total and return the
sum (for City and District)
