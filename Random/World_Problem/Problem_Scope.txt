Design a program that implements the following elements:

World: Contains Countries, States, Cities, and Districts
Country: Contains States, Cities, and Districts - Has a name
State: Contains Cities and Districts - Has a name
City: Contains a population - Has a name
District: Contains a population - Has a name

For each of these entities, the name of the entity is declared in the first
constructor argument and the entities within it are declared in the following
arguments. You can assume that there won't  be any duplicate entities.

World should utilize a constructor that looks like this, don't change it:

public world(Country... entities) {
//
}

Here is an example of how the World will be populated through constructor
calls:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        World myWorld = new World(
                        new Country("USA",
                            new State("NY",
                                new City("New York", 8143197))'
                            new City("LA", 3844829),
                            new City("Chicago", 28425180),
                            new District("Washington D.C.", 658893)),
                        new Country("Germany",
                            new City("Berlin", 3336026),
                            new City("Hamburg", 1605606),
                            new City("Munich", 831937)),
                        new Country("Tamriel",
                            new State("Skyrim",
                                new City("Dragonsreach", 580),
                                new City("Falkreath", 390),
                                new District("Sheogorath's Realm", 666)),
                            new State("Morrowind",
                                new City("Seyda Neen", 46))));

        myWorld.printPopulation();

        System.out.println();
        
        myWorld.printWorld(); 
    }
}

There are two calls you must implement in World:

- printPopulation(): This tallies up all of the populations inside the world.
  You can assume there won't be any duplicate entities, so simply adding all
  the populations created will suffice.

- printWorld(): This prints out each of the entity names in the order in which
  they were declared. So yes, Countries, States, Cities, and Districts will be
  jumbled together, but that's by design. Just print out their names.
